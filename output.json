Idk, maybe it's just my depression/anxiety/neuroticism talking, but personally, I do feel like my physical appearance is wasting away\n\nI have mild body dysmorphia and feel the opposite of how I'm perceived (which is that I'm very attractive). But it feels like \"What's the point?\" if other people's perception about my looks is true. My friend feels the same way about himself as well. On the rare occasion I don't feel ugly like yesterday, I got sad because I remembered \"Oh yeah, there's no one there to appreciate it\". It's gotten to the point where people complimenting me and talking about how I have a great desirable body depresses me and almost makes me feel like a fraud. It's totally irrational I know, but that's how I feel. Whenever I shave my legs or have smooth skin all over my body or wear an outfit I feel good in, I wish I had a romantic partner to genuinely appreciate it\n\nI don't want to be 50 and uglier and feel like I missed out\n\nAlso, please don't say \"You should maintain yourself for you and not to attract others\". Yes I know that, but I'm not in the wrong for wanting physical appreciation from a romantic partner for it\n\nIf this isn't the proper subreddit, let me know because I wasn't sure where to post it",

Idk, maybe it&amp;#39;s just my depression/anxiety/neuroticism talking, but personally, I do feel like my physical appearance is wasting away&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have mild body dysmorphia and feel the opposite of how I&amp;#39;m perceived (which is that I&amp;#39;m very attractive). But it feels like &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the point?&amp;quot; if other people&amp;#39;s perception about my looks is true. My friend feels the same way about himself as well. On the rare occasion I don&amp;#39;t feel ugly like yesterday, I got sad because I remembered &amp;quot;Oh yeah, there&amp;#39;s no one there to appreciate it&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s gotten to the point where people complimenting me and talking about how I have a great desirable body depresses me and almost makes me feel like a fraud. It&amp;#39;s totally irrational I know, but that&amp;#39;s how I feel. Whenever I shave my legs or have smooth skin all over my body or wear an outfit I feel good in, I wish I had a romantic partner to genuinely appreciate it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be 50 and uglier and feel like I missed out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, please don&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;You should maintain yourself for you and not to attract others&amp;quot;. Yes I know that, but I&amp;#39;m not in the wrong for wanting physical appreciation from a romantic partner for it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this isn&amp;#39;t the proper subreddit, let me know because I wasn&amp;#39;t sure where to post it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Joined them in a session of catch via football and it was cool. Also had a great time playing frisbee with another dude.\n\nThe big success/confidence boost for me today was approaching and introducing myself to 2 really beautiful women at the park. I noticed them from the moment I had my towel laid out and was chillin. I told myself that I had to introduce myself and at least interact with them a little because I don't often get these kinds of opportunities. \n\nTo keep a somewhat long story concise, I mustered up some courage, found an opening, we shared introductions and had a quick, but pleasant exchange of small talk and then I made a smooth exit. \n\nThis made me feel so awesome (I'm 27 btw) because most of the time I end up in social situation where my only real opportunity to talk to a woman is at a club or a bar, in a group of 3+ other friends of hers who I don't know. I've shared a lot of advice and offered perspective to folks who've posted their various circumstances on here. \n\nThe point of me sharing this is that although I didn't exchange phone numbers or social media info, the small interaction I did have was pleasant and memorable so that if I run into one or both of those women again I can say what's up and maybe have a more in depth conversation. \n\nI feel so much more confident and better about myself and have a much more positive outlook on getting out there and possibly finding someone.

Joined them in a session of catch via football and it was cool. Also had a great time playing frisbee with another dude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big success/confidence boost for me today was approaching and introducing myself to 2 really beautiful women at the park. I noticed them from the moment I had my towel laid out and was chillin. I told myself that I had to introduce myself and at least interact with them a little because I don&amp;#39;t often get these kinds of opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep a somewhat long story concise, I mustered up some courage, found an opening, we shared introductions and had a quick, but pleasant exchange of small talk and then I made a smooth exit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made me feel so awesome (I&amp;#39;m 27 btw) because most of the time I end up in social situation where my only real opportunity to talk to a woman is at a club or a bar, in a group of 3+ other friends of hers who I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve shared a lot of advice and offered perspective to folks who&amp;#39;ve posted their various circumstances on here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of me sharing this is that although I didn&amp;#39;t exchange phone numbers or social media info, the small interaction I did have was pleasant and memorable so that if I run into one or both of those women again I can say what&amp;#39;s up and maybe have a more in depth conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so much more confident and better about myself and have a much more positive outlook on getting out there and possibly finding someone. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

(I feel like I should ask her out but I'm scared to talk to her like that because it would make things awkward afterwards and I'd have to work a full shift with her in the next upcoming days.)\n\n3. I've flirted with her at a party once, I was more than a little drunk and fear I may have screwed myself before I even got her number. I said \"I just want you to know you're beautiful and I hope you have a safe drive home.\" Right before she left. She didn't say anything and left. Is this a bad sign?

We ended up kissing a lot and his hands definitely roamed. I stopped it there and went home. The problem is, I can't stop thinking about him but I'm certain he's looking for one thing in particular. Part of me wants to reach out to him again, and part of me just wants to run away. I just need some advice.",

I think we really hit it off, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if it was more one-sided or not. I&amp;#39;m nervous about hooking up as I&amp;#39;d prefer it if I trusted the person enough to be able to get physical with them, definitely not on the first date which I told him clearly. We ended up kissing a lot and his hands definitely roamed. I stopped it there and went home. The problem is, I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about him but I&amp;#39;m certain he&amp;#39;s looking for one thing in particular. Part of me wants to reach out to him again, and part of me just wants to run away. I just need some advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He stuck around and we went out, however it seemed more platonic. At the end of the night I initiated a hug and he said \"let me know when you wanna do this again.\" The next two times I initiate something, he travels to see me both times. Still feels platonic, he doesn't touch me or anything. Just a hug that he goes in for at the end of or third \"date\" (mind you he has paid for EVERYTHING so far)\n\nI ask what his intentions are over the phone a few days later and he says \"something platonic (shocked) since he just got out of something serious.\" This is common, I see it all over online dating sites. We go about two weeks without talking, he sends me a snapchat for Easter and the next day I hit him up. We talk on the phone later that week, he says he misses the pizza place we went to. I invite him and we \"go out\" for a fourth date thing. He pays again, I try to be more \"friendly\" in a sense of just acting like I'm hanging with a friend and not a potential partner. At the end of the night, he says he had fun and drops me off at home.\n\nFew days later he texts me, we go back and forth a little but he stops. Next month is me trying to figure out a time to talk on the phone and just sending stupid memes and stuff. He's horrible at texting and takes so long to get back, maybe it's a hint iunno. He finally calls but I can't get the phone. I call back a few hours later and no answer - I text instead of voicemail. Nothing. Been two weeks.\n\nHe's been pretty much absent on social media for the last month or two now. I'm talking logging onto snapchat maybe once in the past month when he used to send me stuff like once a week at least. He could be dead for all I know yet all I want to do is talk to him. Would it be bad to send a text? Is that too desperate? (Mind you I never spammed him, just sent a message maybe once a week the past month)",

A few times she was in the math center but I was busy and was going to leave around that time for a class. I have always been shy and nervous of what a girl would think of me in general. I never had a girlfriend and never asked a girl out. For some reason I think girls don't like me even just the sight of me. Should I not even try dating?",

The only time we spoke was when I was in the cafeteria with my friends and she asked or table a question for her project. A few times she was in the math center but I was busy and was going to leave around that time for a class. I have always been shy and nervous of what a girl would think of me in general. I never had a girlfriend and never asked a girl out. For some reason I think girls don&amp;#39;t like me even just the sight of me. Should I not even try dating?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Up until now though, we have never been single at the same time so we've remained friends. He's made a few flirty jokes, but that's been about as far as it's gotten. I went to a grad party and S was there, but I also met his friend, B. I hung out with both throughout the evening and ended up getting B's number and an invite to S's grad party. I started to talk to B and develop a crush on him, but let him know I did also like someone else without mentioning names. B asked me out, I accepted, then panicked and said we should just remain friends. Something just felt off about it even though he is a sweetheart. I slowly started to give up on S since he still had a girlfriend and B was a great guy. B and I went on a date and got along well, I ended up kissing him at the door. Then I learned that S was single and it really messed with my head. As sweet as B was, I kept having doubts about dating him, especially since I liked S so much. I told him everything I was feeling and he said that he wasn't upset, he already knew I had liked S since the party, but he still did really like me. I've been texting S lately and there is a chance that he likes me. I want to try and pursue it, but I'm afraid of hurting B, straining the friendship between S and B, or making me seem like a bad person to B and I's mutual friends. Help!",

We all had a really good time, drinks at bar, got some ice cream, went to the movies.  \n\n\nI recently wreaked my car and an old coworker that we all worked with invited me to go to her upcoming birthday party, Girl told me about it and asked me and mutual friend if we were going. I told Girl that I couldn't because I had no car, mutual friend said he would be out of town. Girl offered to pick me up and drive me there if I would go, so I said okay.  \n\nTL;DR: I'm crazy in love with this girl that doesn't feel the same way. We're going to a birthday party together, It's about a 30 minute drive to the location...  \n\n\n1.  should I just play it cool and have boring casual conversation both ways up and back and remain in the friendzone?   \n\n2. Do I try to flirt with her and try again to see if I can spark something more, and/or invite her out on another \"date\" (Antman and the Wasp will be out by then)?  \n\n3. Don't go to the birthday party at all and try to cut her out once and for all. \n\nI've tried moving on, but every time I see her in person it's like I fall in love all over again. When do you keep trying and when do you give up?  \nHuman feelings suck. :(   \n",

I suppose I should preface this by saying I've not had much experience of dating or relationships at all. I've had a fling and a sub 3 month relationships so I'm not a complete novice but definitely a beginner.\n\nWe've only been on a couple dates but we've texted/whatsapp pretty much every day in between matching on tinder and the dates (about 1 month real time), we really really get along. She has made every indication that she likes me, even on the second date saying I was her type and that I was good looking. We've hugged and held each other but not kissed yet. Shes really busy as shes a student but also with two jobs so she doesn't answer texts/whatsapp regularly (probs 2 or 3 times a day), plus she has other social commitments.\n\nTo go to the problem I've got, I just can't stop worrying about it all. I will text her and constantly check my phone for replies, sometimes every 5 minutes. I wont reply straight away though. I've resorted to turning my phone off but still I wonder. I'm also in an emotional state like I've never been before. I have a tightness in my chest every time I think about her. I have absolutely no idea why, this is after two fucking dates ...\n\nWe last went out two weeks ago (the 2nd date) and I've tried to arrange a day this week to see her but she said she was busy and that she would get back to me. We had kinda penned in a day but when I asked her about it again two days later she said she was instead seeing a friend but she was very animated in apologising and briefly mentioned a few other days she was free. Yesterday I sent her a text asking her to find a day shes free and to let me know. And that's me caught up to the present.\n\nNow that I've wrote it down it doesn't seem bad at all but here's the questions I've got:\n\nWtf is wrong with me, why am I feeling so fucking emotional? I've never felt like this before. Not with any other girl I've been with. Why have I written out a massive fucking plea for help on reddit?\n\nAm I being too clingy? Should I wait 5-7 days or so and then text her again or what?? I know for a fact she'll reply to the message I last so do I just ignore it for a few days??\n\nShould I get the fuck off my phone and do other shit. Should I go on other dates? I even started running and have seen friends and have go on trips to another state but I just can't stop thinking about her.\n\nPlease be as honest/brutal as you can. Telling me straight is probably the best way to help. PMs are welcome\n\nThank you so much for reading.",
